\subsection{Evaluation of Data Transmissions to/from the Android Emulator}
\subsubsection{Android App as client}

\subsubsection{Android App as server}

The Android Emulator that is shipped with Android Studio puts the virtual device(s) behind a virtual router/firewall, that blocks communication with the host machine by default. In order to test the sending and receiving of TCP/UDP packages, special commands have to be executed allowing the specific flow of packets entering/leaving the virtualized Android instance.\\

The first possibility is to make use of the emulator instance's control console. The following steps are needed: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{telnet localhost 5554} $\rightarrow$ The standard port for the Android Emulator is 5554, it can be inspected in the settings of the actual instance. This command connects to its console.
	\item \texttt{redir add \{tcp|udp\}:<hostPort>:<clientPort>} $\rightarrow$ This command setups a redirection for the specified protocol from the host port to the emulator port, at least in theory. 
\end{itemize}

This method has yielded no usable results, neither with UDP nor with TCP. With UDP 

Not working, broken pipe exception,\\
adb forward tcp:1337 tcp:1337 works (unreliably, but works:  java.io.EOFException)


The second possibility makes use of the so-called Android Debugging Bridge (ADB). Once the emulator is running, the command can just be called like this: \texttt{adb forward tcp:<hostPort> tcp:<clientPort>}.

The ADB command has yielded some success, as can be seen in the Wireshark traces of figure \ref{fig:wire1} where a TCP stream is being followed. 

Following TCP stream:\\
\texttt{....sr..communication.Message...........L..messaget..Ljava/lang/String;xpt..Hello from the JVM}
